Plugin for displaying a feed for your latest Git commits on a portfolio site.

TODO:
1. Use transients to cache data, so I'm not resending the api requests every time the page is refreshed.
2. Implement OAuth 2.0 Authentication.
3. Use regexp to make the patch data look pretty.

COMPLETED: 

~~Rewrite remaining asynchronous requests code to use the WordPress Requests class.~~
~~Implement object orientation.~~
